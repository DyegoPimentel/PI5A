# Sentiment analysis and wordclouds in Python

The code in this repository was created for the integrator project of the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Degree at PUC-Goiás, aims to develop a Data Mining algorithm linked to social networks.

In this scenario, we developed a sentiment analysis algorithm and at the end we bring a wordcloud to give an overview of what is being said about the topic we are analyzing.
